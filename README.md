👋 Hi, I’m an AI / Data Engineer

I design and build end-to-end data & AI systems — from large-scale data ingestion to analytics, machine learning, and AI-powered applications.

I specialize in Data Engineering, Data Streaming, Data Science, and MLOps, with a strong focus on Azure, scalable architectures, and production-ready solutions.

🚀 What I Work On

Data Engineering: Azure Data Factory, SQL, star schemas, analytics-ready data warehouses

Machine Learning: regression models, feature engineering, model evaluation on real-world datasets

AI & RAG Systems: LLM-powered chatbots, document search, recruiter-facing AI assistants

🧠 Mindset

I focus on production-ready solutions, clean architectures, and explainable systems.
I enjoy bridging data, AI, and software engineering to turn complex problems into usable products.

📌 Current Focus

AI-powered portfolios & RAG chatbots for recruiters

Scalable data platforms on Azure

MLOps best practices with Docker & cloud tooling
